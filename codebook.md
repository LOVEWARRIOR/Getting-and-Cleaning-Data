#X_test,y_test,subject_test are dataframes which read the files and with the column names from features
#so do train series
#clean1 is the merged data
#clean3 is the data with variables including mean , standard deviation subject and label
#ans is a clean data but without readable names 
#tidy data is my final data
#create a dataframe with same names with clean3
#the only for loop computes the mean value of each variable for each label and each subject
